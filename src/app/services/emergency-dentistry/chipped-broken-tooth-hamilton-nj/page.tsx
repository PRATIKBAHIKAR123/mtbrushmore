    question: "What should I do right away if my child chips or breaks a tooth?",
    answer:
      "Rinse their mouth gently with water and look for any loose tooth pieces, but do not try to glue anything back. Call us immediately - quick care helps prevent pain and further damage. If there is swelling, a cold compress can help until you arrive.",
